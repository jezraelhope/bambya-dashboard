## Description
This dashboard was created for a friend who uses options wheel strategy for his trades. It features a main page that shows his trades that are segregated by month and a table that separates trades according to expiration date. It also has a side menu to filter out trades according to year and months. To add trades, a form was added on the right hand side which creates a post request to the node API that handles all database calls. Each trade is also editable and can be deleted if chosen.

I had so much fun creating this project and learned so much about the backend side of web development. I still want to improve upon this project and add more features such as authentication, a main page for first time visitors and data visualization to show charts and other important data for the user.

## Technologies Used
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Nodejs
- Mongodb
- Express
- Mongoose

## Expected Features
- Show all trades in the main page
- Side Menu that filters all trades according to year and month of expiration
- Add trade form
- Edit trades
- Delete trades
- Close trades and calculate profit.
- Ability to use POST, DELETE, PUT and GET requests
- Organize fetched data from Mongodb to make it usable for the frontend


## Additional Features in the Future
- Authentication (separation of different users for security)
- Fetching real time price of a specific stock from an API
- Better UX/UI

## Things I Learned While Building This Project
- Connecting Frontend to the Backend
- Better understanding of the fetch API
- Better understanding of the useEffect hook
- Basic understanding of backend technologies such as nodejs, express and mongoose
- Basic understanding of Mongodb
- I've learned that dates as a data type are quite tricky to manipulate which required me to research more about date methods
